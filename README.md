# Idle Crypto Miner for Linux
I noticed a lack of solutions to idle mining in Linux and decided to fix that. Currently the entire project is just a simple python script that runs xmr-stak while idle, but I plan on making a gui (no promises though). I might also implement a configuration file so you're not only limited to running xmr-stak (again, no promises). If any of these plans come to fruition, it'll be during the summer when I have more time to code.
